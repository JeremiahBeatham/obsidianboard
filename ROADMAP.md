# Tabula Rasa — Roadmap

Where the plugin is today and where it's headed. Items link to their tracking
issues. Phases are intent, not hard commitments, and may reorder based on feedback.

## ✅ Shipped (v0.1.x → v0.2.0 MVP)

- Natural, pressure-tapered drawing (perfect-freehand) for finger, Apple Pencil,
  mouse, or stylus — with velocity-based taper when there's no real pressure.
- Mobile-first input: Pointer Events with coalesced sampling, no accidental
  scrolling, optional palm rejection.
- Pen, highlighter, eraser (whole-stroke); color palette; brush sizes; undo/redo;
  clear.
- Pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan, wheel-zoom, fit-to-screen.
- Theme-aware pen (white on dark, black on light).
- Re-editable `.sketch` (JSON) files with autosave + explicit save.
- On-demand PNG/SVG export (embed-in-note or save-only — no surprise image files).
- **Live inline previews** of `.sketch` embeds in notes (Reading view + Live
  Preview), kept in sync and click-to-edit.
- Rebrand to **Tabula Rasa** and community-store prep (LICENSE, compliant id/name).
- Consistent bundled tool icon across ribbon, view tab, and commands
  ([#6](https://github.com/JeremiahBeatham/TabulaRasa/issues/6), v0.2.1).
- On-canvas canvas resize: aspect presets (square, 4:3, 16:9, A4), anchor or
  scale-to-fit, and fit-to-drawing
  ([#8](https://github.com/JeremiahBeatham/TabulaRasa/issues/8), v0.3.0).
- Brush-size picker: slider, presets, and live preview in a popover
  ([#10](https://github.com/JeremiahBeatham/TabulaRasa/issues/10), v0.4.0).
- Color picker: custom color + recent colors alongside the palette
  ([#11](https://github.com/JeremiahBeatham/TabulaRasa/issues/11), v0.5.0).
